This code will generate a dynamic phantom and perform a low rank reconstruction. The spatiotemporal dynamics are severely undersampled, with a single line of the 64-by-64 matrix size problem being sampled at every reconstructed time point.

Code is included, with permission, from Jeff Fessler's IRT toolbox. The updated version of that code is at: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/
